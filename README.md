This research analyses the open dataset available in University of California Irvine Machine Learning 
Repository and performs exploratory data analysis, data visualisation, standardisation, and feature selection as part 
of feature engineering. 
Correlation and Chi-Squared feature selection methods are used but it is not ideal for the dataset 
with limited features. 
Furthermore, it compares the results obtained from eight different machine learning algorithms, which are: 
Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes classification, 
K-Nearest Neighbor, Gradient Boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory.
